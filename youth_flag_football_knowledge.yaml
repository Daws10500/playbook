  overview:
    summary: >
      Flag football is a non-contact version of American football where defenders stop the ball carrier
      by pulling a flag from a belt instead of tackling.
    emphasis:
      - "Speed and agility."
      - "Basic football strategy and decision-making."
      - "Reduced collision risk for kids."
    common_league_features:
      - "5v5 or 6v6 on a reduced-size field."
      - "Co-ed teams grouped by age divisions."
      - "Running clock games, often 2x20–25 minute halves."

  skills_and_coaching:
    practice_structure:
      typical_practice_flow:
        - "Warm-up: light running, dynamic stretching, simple tag/flag games."
        - "Individual skills: flag pulling, passing, catching, footwork, agility."
        - "Group drills: routes versus air, basic coverage alignments, small-sided games."
        - "Short scrimmage plus review and encouragement at the end."

    offensive_skills:

        - "Proper grip and stance."
        - "Step-and-throw mechanics with follow-through."
        - "Simple progression reads (first read, second read, checkdown)."

        - "Catching with hands extended, eyes on ball."
        - "'Diamond' or 'alligator' hand techniques depending on pass height."
        - "Tuck ball quickly after catch and protect flags."

    defensive_skills:
      flag_pulling:
        key_points:
          - "Short, controlled steps approaching ball carrier."
          - "Eyes on hips instead of ball."
          - "Grab and pull flag firmly; avoid wild swipes."
      coverage_basics:
        man_coverage:
          - "Line up between receiver and end zone."
          - "Maintain cushion and watch hips, not fakes."
        zone_coverage:
          - "Drop to assigned area and watch QB eyes."
          - "Break on the ball once thrown, not before."

  safety_sportsmanship_philosophy:
    safety:
      - "Reinforce non-contact; players must avoid collisions and slow near traffic."
      - "Teach controlled flag pulls instead of diving into opponents."
    sportsmanship:
      - "Shake hands before/after games; praise effort from both teams."
      - "Respect officials and opponents; no taunting."
    developmental_philosophy:
      - "Rotate players through multiple positions to broaden learning."
      - "Prioritize fun, fundamentals, and confidence over wins and losses."

  offensive_tactics:
    principles:
      core:
        - "Small, versatile playbook: 6–10 core plays with mirrored and tagged variations."
        - "Call plays your group can execute under pressure, even if simple."
        - "Use formations, motion, and route combos to move defenders, then attack resulting space."
        - "Show the same formation repeatedly while running different concepts to avoid defensive anticipation."
      example_series:
        description: "Run Trips Right three times but target different routes each time (slant, out, go) to prevent pattern recognition."

    formations_and_mismatches:
      common_formations:
        - name: "Spread"
          structure: "Two receivers on each side, center in middle."
          usage:
            - "Clear middle for quick slants, hooks, or RB draws."
        - name: "Trips"
          structure: "Three receivers on one side, one on the other."
          usage:
            - "Overload one side and force coverage communication on crossers and floods."
        - name: "Bunch"
          structure: "Three receivers tightly grouped in a triangle."
          usage:
            - "Create natural traffic at the snap to free a short route."
        - name: "Stack"
          structure: "Two receivers lined up directly behind each other."
          usage:
            - "Hide release direction and stress man coverage assignments."
      mismatch_principles:
        - "Place best athlete on weaker defender, often isolated opposite trips."
        - "Use deep clears by fast players to open underneath routes for others."

    motion_and_pre_snap_deception:
      concepts:
        benefits:
          - "Helps identify man vs zone coverage via defender reactions."
          - "Forces defense to adjust alignment late, increasing chances of miscommunication."
          - "Allows same core play to be run from multiple looks."
        common_motions:
          - name: "Jet"
            description: "Receiver runs across formation before snap, threatening quick handoff or flat route."
          - name: "Slide"
            description: "Receiver shifts a few steps to build or break a bunch/trips look just before snap."

    route_combinations:
      high_percentage_combos:
        - name: "Slant + Out"
          description: "One receiver slants inside, another runs quick out; defenders may collide or hesitate in man coverage."
        - name: "Post + Corner"
          description: "Inside receiver runs post, outside runs corner, forcing deep defenders to switch or lose leverage."
        - name: "Go + Under"
          description: "Outside go clears deep coverage; inside drag/under exploits space behind shallow defenders."
        - name: "Levels"
          description: "Short route at 3–5 yards plus deeper route at 8–10 on same side to stress one zone defender vertically."
      qb_read_guidelines:
        - "Limit to one or two reads for youth QBs (e.g., short route first, then deep)."
        - "Coach pre-snap ideas: know primary matchup and coverage clue before snap."

    attacking_common_defenses:
      vs_man:
        defensive_profile: "Man-to-man with one dedicated rusher is standard at youth levels."
        tactics:
          - "Use stacks/bunches to create traffic and natural rubs at release (within rules)."
          - "Exploit weakest defender by isolating your best receiver."
          - "Use motion to drag defenders away from intended target and throw back into vacated area."
      vs_zone:
        defensive_profile: "Simple 2-short / 2-deep or umbrella-style zones are common."
        tactics:
          - "Flood one side with multiple routes at different depths (flat, corner, go)."
          - "Sit receivers between zones or just behind shallow defenders."
          - "Throw quickly into the area vacated by a rusher."

    game_winning_and_deception_sequences:
      setup_and_counter_pattern:
        steps:
          - "Call a safe, quick concept several times (e.g., quick out to your best receiver from trips)."
          - "Observe defense overplaying route or side (corner jumping out, safety shading)."
          - "Call a complementary shot from same look (e.g., out-and-up, post behind jumped out, wheel route up sideline)."
      end_game_situations:
        tactics:
          - "Use misdirection screens: show quick screen one way, then throw slant/post behind flowing defenders."
          - "Use sideline routes (outs, comebacks) to gain yards and stop clock before final shot."
          - "In no-run zone near goal line, scheme crossing routes that quickly separate at the goal line."

    simplified_play_calling_framework:
      naming_structure:
        formation_word: "Spread | Trips | Bunch | Stack"
        concept_word: "Slant-Out | Levels | Flood | Go-Under"
        optional_tag: "Motion (Jet, Slide) or primary read (e.g., Z)"
      examples:
        - call: "Trips Right Slant-Out Z"
          meaning: "Trips right formation, slant/out combo, Z receiver is primary read."
        - call: "Bunch Left Flood Jet"
          meaning: "Bunch left, flood concept on that side, with jet motion across before snap."
      llm_guideline: >
        When generating new plays, prioritize clarity and age-appropriate complexity, but systematically apply
        formation, motion, and route-combination concepts to stress defenses rather than relying on random routes.

        name: "Angle"
        depth_yards: "3-6"
        break_direction: "Out then sharply back inside"
        description: >

        name: "Swing"
        depth_yards: "Behind LOS to 3"
        break_direction: "Outside, slightly upfield"

        Additional RB routes:
          Angle: start like Flat (1) to outside, then cut back sharply across middle.
          Swing: bubble path wide toward sideline from backfield, staying shallow.
    llm_usage_notes:
      - "Use the numeric system to let plays specify exact routes per receiver, e.g., 'Trips Right 2-9-5' for three receivers."
      - "When teaching youth, emphasize the names (slant, out, go) first, then gradually introduce numbers."
      - "Route depths should be scaled down for age and QB arm strength; maintain relative relationships (short vs intermediate vs deep)."

    rule_scope_note: >
      Rules and values here reflect common youth and NFL FLAG–style standards but may differ from specific leagues;
      league rulebooks should override these defaults when available.
    customization_suggestions:
      - "Override field dimensions, timing, and scoring from official league documents as needed."
      - "Parameterize age group and format (5v5 vs 6v6) when generating drills or plays."
    content_guidelines_for_children:
      - "Use clear, simple language and avoid technical jargon."
      - "Emphasize safety, teamwork, and sportsmanship in all generated content."
      - "Favor repetition and small number of core concepts over large complex playbooks."
